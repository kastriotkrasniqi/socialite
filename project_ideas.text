====== Friend Recommendations ======
Recommendation Algorithm: Use mutual friends or shared interests (e.g., groups or events) to recommend friends. You could suggest people who have the highest number of mutual friends.
==============



====== Caching  ======
Friend List Caching: For active users, cache the friend list to reduce repetitive database queries.

For users with large friend lists, cache the results of friendship queries. This will improve performance when displaying lists or fetching mutual friends. Use tools like Redis or Laravelâ€™s built-in caching system to store frequently accessed data.
===============



====== Pivot Model (Optional)  ======
Although you're not required to create a pivot model, if your friendship system grows complex and you need to interact with pivot data directly, you can optionally create a Friendship model. This is especially useful if you need more logic around the pivot data.
